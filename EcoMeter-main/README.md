   - Monthly electricity and LPG usage  
   - Diet type  
2. On clicking **\"Calculate\"**, emissions are computed using fixed factors:
   - Car: 0.21 kg/km  
   - Electricity: 0.9 kg/unit  
   - LPG: 2.983 kg/cylinder  
   - Diet types: 600–300 kg/year, divided monthly  
3. Output includes:
   - Total emissions per month  
   - Breakdown by category
